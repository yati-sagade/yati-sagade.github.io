I'm Yati Sagade and this a log of my explorations. I am a software engineer at
[Booking.com][3].  [Follow me on Twitter][1] or [drop me a mail][2]. Here's my
[résumé][4].


## Interests
I am interested in programming, compilers, computer vision, physics and the
meaning of life, the universe and everything. My projects can be found mostly
on [my github page][5].
