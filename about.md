I'm Yati Sagade and this a log of my explorations (so all opinions expressed are mine). I like Blues, Rock,  Indian Classical music and colourful socks. I enjoy walking and think it is a great exercise for the body and the mind. Wireless headphones/mice/keyboards are not my thing, nor is voice controlled UI.
