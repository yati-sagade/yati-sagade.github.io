title: Seeüberquerung 2022

I participated in the [Seeüberquerung](https://www.seeueberquerung.ch/en/) this
year. About 6500 people swam from the Strandbad Mythenquai across the Lake
Zurich to the Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen.

I had to bail after the 800m mark, and even that I swam with about 10 breaks!

Things I learned:

1. My breaststroke technique sucks. I use too much of my upper body, whereas
   most of the propulsion should come from the legs. This caused me to get tired
   every 100m or so.
2. Swimming open waters is very different from swimming in pools: You have
   waves, the floor is invisible, there is no option of swimming to the side and
   resting, and looking to the other side is much scarier

I'd signed up for the event _only_ after seeing that there will be resting boats
throughout the swim path for people who get tired, with an option to be carried
to the other end in a boat.

Some impressions:

1. There were resting boats _every 50m_. I'd signed up for the event only
   because I read there will be boats, with an option to be carried to the other
   shore any time. But having so many (23) boats over the 1500m path allowed me
   to go from boat to boat, hanging out with the lifeguards along the way.
2. The warmup session was the best part of the event for me! Whoever the person
   leading the warmup session was, he was amazing. I usually don't like group
   aerobics sessions, but this was a different game.
3. Overall the event was very well organised -- from the compost toilets, to the
   batching of swimmers over comfortable time periods, to the aforementioned
   resting boats with expert lifeguards, it was very smooth.

I am motivated to improve my technique and participate next year!
