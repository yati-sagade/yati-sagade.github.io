I got this pop-up recently and while it must be from some desktop application
that uses Electron.js, it's not apparent which.

An easy way to tell is to run:

```shell
$ xprop
```

This will change the mouse pointer (to a cross-hair pointer on my Gnome
3 desktop), as the `xprop` invocation waits. Clicking with this on the target
window will make `xprop` print a bunch of information about it, including the
name of the main application window and its pid:


```shell
...
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "discord", "Discord"
WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = "Error"
...
```
